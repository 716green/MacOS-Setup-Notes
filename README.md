Remove `Command Tab` binding from MacOS, Replace with AltTab<br>
Reassign Spotlight to `Option Tab`

<h3>
Karabiner Elements (Single and Preset Keybindings)

`Fn + Delete` for `Forward Delete`

## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your project.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

**Backup Extensions**
_This will overwrite the current list_

```bash
# Update Extensions
code --list-extensions > install-extensions.txt
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```bash
# Install Extensions listed in install-extensions.txt
sh install-extensions.sh
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
